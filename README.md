# HDF5 and pandas
Tutorial on HDF5 and pandas for PyData Barcelona

Here are my materials for the tutorial on Fri 19, 2017 in PyData Barcelona 2017.

You can get the latest release of the materials from here:

https://github.com/FrancescAlted/PyData-BCN/releases

Also, make sure that you have the next Python packages installed:

* Jupyter notebook
* numpy
* h5py
* tables (pytables)
* pandas
* matplotlib
* cartopy

I recommend to use Anaconda to install most of the packages above
and start by the different tutorials following the numerical order.

**Note**: The cartopy package may not exist in the regular conda channel, so
in order to install it, try the `conda-forge` channel instead:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge cartopy
```

** Enjoy data! **
